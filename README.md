# pickup10.org iOS native wrapper

In order to have app presence in the Apple App Store this projects wraps pickup10.org.com in a native wrapper. To keep complexity low we used [Expo](https://expo.io/) in combination with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to do so.

## Running the project locally

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

For more info see the [Expo docs]()

## Deployment to the App Store

See [Expo docs on distributing you app](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/distribution/introduction/).
